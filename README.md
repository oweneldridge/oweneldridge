I'm a full-stack engineer with 5+ years of experience building healthcare, fitness, and payment systems. I've worked across the stack—React frontends, Go/Python backends, AWS infrastructure and led technical initiatives at companies ranging from fitness tech to healthcare platforms.

Currently working in healthcare tech and exploring AI/ML integration, developer tooling, and ways to make software more accessible.

## Experience

### Healthcare Technology Platform

**Full-Stack Software Engineer III** at healthcare technology company

Building GraphQL APIs and React applications for healthcare claims processing and member data management. Work spans backend services in Go, frontend applications in React 18/TypeScript, and AWS infrastructure (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB).

Recent work includes fixing critical production bugs that prevented revenue loss, building Python automation tools that cut manual analysis time from hours to minutes, and coordinating deployments across multiple repositories.

**Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Go, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, AWS, Python, Playwright, DataDog

---

### Payment Platform Architecture

**Technical Lead** at enterprise fitness technology company

Led the restructuring of monolithic Lambda functions into modular microservices with 80% test coverage. Integrated TriPOS Cloud API with Payrix for point-of-sale terminal payments and built a webhook management system using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.

Also built a secure payment component in Next.js 14 for handling credit cards and bank accounts, authored Python coding standards for the team (PEP 8/257), and mentored junior engineers through mentorship, collaboration, pair programming, and code reviews.

**Stack:** Python 3.10+, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, PyTest

---

### Fitness Technology Platform

**Full-Stack Engineer** at enterprise fitness technology company

Built payment integrations with Payfac and Plaid for routing number verification, developed AWS Lambda infrastructure for payment processing, and worked across Django/Python backend and Next.js/EmberJS frontend.

Set up Selenium UI tests and established linting standards for both Python and EmberJS codebases.

**Stack:** Django, Python, AWS Lambda, Next.js, EmberJS, Selenium, Payfac, Plaid

### [Spearmint](https://github.com/open-source-labs/spearmint)

**Full-Stack Engineer** on accessibility-focused GUI for JavaScript testing

Open source project with 1,000+ GitHub stars. I replaced heavy dependencies with lighter alternatives (300% performance improvement), optimized the code editor to reduce memory usage by 60%, and improved TypeScript coverage throughout the React-Redux codebase.

Spearmint helps developers write better tests with a focus on accessibility, which is something I care about.

**Stack:** Node.js, Electron, React, Redux, TypeScript, NoSQL

### Outside of work

When I'm not coding you might find me playing guitar/drums/piano, reading a good book, retro gaming, cycling, at goldendoodle meetups, woodworking, ice carving (yep, really), traveling, cooking, or tutoring IELTS/TOEFL.
